#Node Server Routing Example
This project is used to display the difference between server routing and
client side rendering. This project shows how server routing works with express
and some html files.

##React client side rendering
This project has a comparison project that can be found [here](https://github.com/aaronjwhowie/rRoutng-Demo)
The linked project above uses react with react router to render pages without
constantly refreshing the browser, unlike the code made in this repo.
